## 👩‍🌾 About This Project

I'm Angel, a 2nd year Agriculture student from the Philippines
with zero coding experience — until February 16, 2026.

This is my first R project. I built a dataset from scratch
using real Philippine provinces and analyzed animal population
across Cagayan, Isabela, and Kalinga.

## 📊 What I Did

- ✅ Created a custom agricultural dataset (angel_farm)
- ✅ Explored data structure and summary statistics
- ✅ Filtered by animal type (Chicken, Pig, Cow)
- ✅ Grouped and summarized by province
- ✅ Visualized results using ggplot2

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Kalinga has the highest chicken population at 20,000
- Chicken is the most dominant animal across all 3 provinces
- Total chicken population (39,000) exceeds cows and pigs combined

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- R 4.5.2
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- Posit Cloud
